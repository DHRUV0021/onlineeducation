    title:"Software Engineering",
    desc: "    Software engineers work in almost every field. They design, maintain and test various computer software programs. If you enjoy working with computers and solving problems, then you may consider pursuing the profession of a software engineer. In this article, we examine how to become a software engineer and discuss what skills and qualifications you need to excel in this career.",
    alldetails:" A software engineer designs develops and builds computer software. Every piece of software and application you have on your computers and smartphones is probably designed by a team of software engineers. They are able to do this by learning the languages that computers use to operate. Computer engineering is in evergreen demand, making this an attractive career option for professionals who enjoy working with computers and creative problem-solving. Software engineers mostly spend their days in an office setting behind a desk. Most of their time may go towards working on current projects, with occasional team meetings. Many software engineers may also be able to work remotely. Software engineers may also have flexible working hours, provided they handle their workload and meet all their deadlines consistently.",
    skill:"To become a software engineer, a candidate has to pass higher secondary school with physics, chemistry and mathematics as their focus subjects. A minimum of 55% marks in higher secondary board examinations may be required to gain admission into reputed engineering colleges. The most appropriate course to pursue would be a BTech (Bachelor of Technology) in computer science engineering or a related field, like information technology. You may also consider other degree programmes like BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application). Some prominent colleges offering these courses are",
    IITS:"*  IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology)",
    BITS:"*  BITS (Birla Institute of Technology and Science)",
    IISc:"*  IISc (Indian Institute of Science)",
    NITS:"*  NITs (National Institutes of Technology)",
    BETC:"*   BTech admission process may vary from state to state for local colleges. For national-level colleges, the most popular procedure is to clear the nationwide JEE (Joint Entrance Examination), which happens in two parts - Mains and Advanced. After graduation, candidates can also pursue postgraduate courses in computer science engineering to improve job prospects and earning potential.",

    Graduate:"(1)  Graduate from a higher secondary school :-> To become a software engineer, you have to graduate from higher secondary school with a focus on subjects like physics, chemistry and mathematics. Learning computer science and basic coding at the school level can orient you to the education that lies ahead. Once you graduate from higher secondary school, you can appear for national-level entrance examinations like JEE or an entrance exam conducted by your state education department, to gain admission into engineering colleges.",
    Pursue:"(2)  Pursue a bachelor's degree :->  After you complete schooling, pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering or information technology. A bachelor's degree is the most common requirement for software engineering positions. A completed bachelor's degree demonstrates that you have received advanced training in software engineering.",
    Apply :"(3)  Apply for entry-level jobs :-> After you obtain a bachelor's degree in the field, you can start applying for jobs. Software engineers are required in both IT and non-IT fields. Apply for entry-level software engineering roles after you prepare a resume and portfolio. Keep updating your skills and knowledge to apply for positions in reputed companies in the field.",
    Complete:"(4)   Complete an internship :->  Completing an internship is often a good idea if you want to become a software engineer. Internships give you real-world experience and allow you to make connections within the industry. In some cases, the internship can even turn into a part-time or full-time position. Internships are often a requirement in many bachelor's degree programs. If not, you can find one on your own after receiving your degree.",
